# OBSOLETE - REPLACED BY ORBIT_ANIMATION_SPECIFICATION.md

This file has been replaced by `ORBIT_ANIMATION_SPECIFICATION.md` which contains the correct specification for the xAI-inspired orbit-like particle animation.

The previous flowing curves approach was incorrect. The new specification implements the actual animation pattern observed on the xAI website.
