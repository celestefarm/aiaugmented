# Product Requirements Document: Agentic Boardroom

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
The Agentic Boardroom is a cognitive workspace that fundamentally transforms high-stakes strategic decision-making by seamlessly integrating fluid, human-led exploration with structured, AI-driven analysis. It bridges the critical gap between brainstorming and formal communication, replacing chaos with clarity through a unified, end-to-end environment for making better, faster, and more defensible strategic decisions.

### 1.2 Core Problem Statement
Traditional strategic planning suffers from four critical challenges:
- **Fragmented Information**: Ideas, risks, and data scattered across multiple platforms with no single source of truth
- **Cognitive Blind Spots**: Human decision-making prone to biases without structured challenge mechanisms
- **The "Lost in Translation" Gap**: Difficulty converting creative brainstorming energy into coherent, persuasive stakeholder reports
- **Lack of Dynamic Interaction**: Static documents that don't support real-time "what-if" analysis or collaborative pressure-testing

### 1.3 Solution Overview
The application provides a two-mode solution that guides users through a complete decision-making lifecycle:

**Exploration Map**: A dynamic, visual workspace for divergent thinking where teams externalize complex decision spaces, understand intricate relationships, and collaborate with specialized AI agents in real-time sparring sessions.

**Last-Mile Brief**: A structured environment for convergent thinking that synthesizes complexity into executive-ready reports with full traceability back to underlying reasoning.

## 2. Product Architecture

### 2.1 Core User Workflows

#### 2.1.1 Primary Workflow: Core Strategy Development Cycle
**Step 1: Framing the Challenge**
- User customizes workspace title (e.g., "Q4 APAC Market Entry Strategy")
- Creates initial "Core Challenge" node as the strategic anchor

**Step 2: Mapping the Landscape (Divergent Thinking)**
- Populates Exploration Map with nodes representing:
  - Options: Potential solutions or paths forward
  - Dependencies: Requirements for success
  - Assumptions: Underlying beliefs
  - Risks: Potential obstacles
- Creates edges to define relationships (causality, conflict, support)

**Step 3: Collaborative Sparring & AI Augmentation**
- Activates relevant AI agents from the left panel
- Engages in "Sparring Session" conversations
- AI agents analyze the map and provide:
  - Challenge assumptions
  - Surface hidden risks
  - Suggest new perspectives
- Incorporates insights as new nodes on the map

**Step 4: Identifying a Path Forward (Convergent Thinking)**
- Reviews holistic view of decision space
- Identifies most viable path and primary recommendation
- Marks key decision points

**Step 5: Synthesizing the Narrative**
- Switches to "Last-Mile Brief" view
- AI generates first draft from highest-conviction map nodes

**Step 6: Refining and Finalizing**
- Edits and refines AI-generated content
- Reviews and includes optional insights
- Creates polished, data-informed strategic document

#### 2.1.2 Secondary Workflows
- **Asynchronous Review and Contribution**: Team members join via shared links to review and contribute
- **Focused Risk and Scenario Analysis**: Pressure-testing existing strategies with specialized agents

### 2.2 Data Architecture

#### 2.2.1 Core Strategic Elements
**Nodes**: Atomic units of strategic thought containing:
- Title and Description
- Type classification (Core Challenge, Option, Risk, Dependency, Agent Suggestion)
- Metadata (Confidence Score, Feasibility rating, Impact level)
- State (position, visual appearance)

**Edges**: Relational data defining logical relationships:
- Relationship types (supports, contradicts, depends on, informs)
- Visual styling (solid, dashed, dotted, colored)

#### 2.2.2 Conversational Content
- **Chat Messages**: Time-stamped entries from users, AI agents, and collaborators
- **AI Justifications**: Explanatory tooltips showing AI reasoning
- **Collaborative Input**: Domain expertise from team members

#### 2.2.3 Synthesized Outputs
- **Brief Document**: Structured report with rich text, tables, and timelines
- **Data Visualizations**: Charts and graphs summarizing key metrics
- **Workspace Configuration**: Agent settings, model selection, workspace state

### 2.3 AI Agent System

#### 2.3.1 Individual Agent Function
**Context-Awareness**: Each agent accesses complete workspace context including:
- Current state of Exploration Map (all nodes and edges)
- Full Sparring Session history
- User's immediate prompt

**Role-Specialization**: Agents configured with specific personas:
- **Risk & Compliance Agent**: Pessimistic risk manager identifying failures and regulatory hurdles
- **Strategist Agent**: Optimistic visionary generating strategic options and framing trade-offs
- **Mentor & Decision Coach Agent**: Meta-role challenging assumptions and surfacing biases
- **Market & Competitor Agent**: External environment specialist
- **Execution & Operations Agent**: Implementation and feasibility expert
- **Brief & Communications Agent**: Synthesis and narrative specialist

#### 2.3.2 Multi-Agent Collaboration
Agents function as a collaborative team through a "cognitive assembly line":
1. **Strategist Agent** frames the problem and generates initial options
2. **Specialist Agents** (Risk, Market, etc.) scrutinize and build upon each other's insights
3. **Execution Agent** translates vetted strategies into concrete plans
4. **Brief Agent** synthesizes everything into coherent documentation
