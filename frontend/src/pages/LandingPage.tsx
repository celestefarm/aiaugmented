              You've spent years cultivating deep knowledge, developing intuition, and earning respect through hard-won experience. Now you watch as AI tools produce in minutes what once took you days to perfect. The question haunts you: <strong>Is my accumulated wisdom just expensive overhead in an automated world?</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="pain-description mt-3 text-sm opacity-75">
              <strong>The ripple effect is real:</strong> You hesitate in strategy meetings. You over-research simple decisions. You find yourself apologizing for approaches that have served you well for years.

            <p className="pain-description mt-3 text-sm opacity-75">
              <strong>The isolation is crushing:</strong> You can't admit your struggles to your teamâ€”they look to you for leadership. You can't confess to your peersâ€”they seem to be adapting effortlessly.

              You've seen the headlines. You've watched entire departments get "optimized." You know that your salary could fund three junior hires plus enterprise AI tools. The math is simple, and it terrifies you.
