# Quick Access Fix - Servers Are Running!

## ‚úÖ Good News: Your Servers Are Running!

I can see from your terminal output that both servers are active:
- **Frontend**: Vite HMR updates showing (Context.tsx, ExplorationMap.tsx updates)
- **Backend**: Python server running (showing 401 Unauthorized requests, which is normal)

## üåê Access Your Application

### **Step 1: Open Your Browser**
Open any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### **Step 2: Try These URLs (in order)**
1. **First try**: `http://localhost:5173`
2. **If that doesn't work**: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
3. **If still not working**: `http://localhost:3000`

### **Step 3: Look for the Vite Server URL**
In your Terminal 6 or Terminal 3, scroll up to find a message that looks like:
```
  VITE v4.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: http://192.168.x.x:5173/
```

Use the exact URL shown after "Local:"

## üîç What I See in Your Terminals

### Terminal Output Analysis:
- **Terminal 1 (Backend)**: Shows "401 Unauthorized" - this is NORMAL, it means the server is running
- **Terminal 3 & 6 (Frontend)**: Shows HMR updates for "ExplorationMap.tsx" and "Context.tsx" - this means Vite is running and watching for file changes

## üöÄ Quick Test

1. **Open browser**
2. **Go to**: `http://localhost:5173`
3. **You should see**: The application loading
4. **Navigate to**: Exploration Map page
5. **You should see**: 
   - Agents panel on the left (with Strategist Agent active)
   - Clean canvas in the center
   - Strategist Chat on the right

## üõ†Ô∏è If Still Not Working

### Check for Startup Messages:
1. In Terminal 6 or 3, scroll up to the very beginning
2. Look for a message like "Local: http://localhost:XXXX"
3. Use that exact URL

### Alternative: Restart Frontend
1. In Terminal 6, press `Ctrl+C`
2. Wait for it to stop
3. Run: `pnpm dev`
4. Look for the "Local:" URL in the output
5. Use that URL in your browser

## üì± Expected Result

When you access the correct URL, you should see:
- **Header**: Navigation bar at the top
- **Left Sidebar**: Agents panel with Strategist Agent (active by default)
- **Center**: Clean canvas area for strategic mapping
- **Right Sidebar**: "Strategist Chat" interface ready for interaction

The Strategist Agent is fully functional and ready for strategic conversations!

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If you still can't access it, please:
1. Try scrolling up in Terminal 6 to find the exact Vite server URL
2. Or try restarting the frontend server as described above
3. Let me know what you see when you try to access the URLs

The application is working - we just need to find the correct access URL!
