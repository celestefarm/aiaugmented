# Port Fix Solution - Found the Issue!

## 🎯 The Problem
Your Vite configuration is set to run on **port 5137**, not the default 5173!

Looking at `frontend/vite.config.ts` line 9:
```typescript
server: {
  host: "::",
  port: 5137,  // ← This is the actual port!
},
```

## 🌐 Correct URLs to Try

### **Primary URL**: `http://localhost:5137`
### **Alternative**: `http://127.0.0.1:5137`

## 🚀 Quick Test Steps

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to**: `http://localhost:5137` (note the 5137, not 5173)
3. **You should see**: The application loading successfully

## ✅ What You Should See

When you access `http://localhost:5137`, you'll see:
- **Header**: Navigation bar at the top
- **Left Sidebar**: Agents panel with Strategist Agent (active)
- **Center Canvas**: Clean strategic mapping area
- **Right Sidebar**: "Strategist Chat" interface ready for interaction

## 🔧 Alternative: Change Port to 5173

If you prefer to use the standard port 5173, I can update the Vite config for you. But first, try accessing `http://localhost:5137` - it should work immediately!

## 📝 Terminal Confirmation

When your server starts, you should see something like:
```
VITE v6.x.x  ready in xxx ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5137/
➜  Network: http://[::]:5137/
```

The "Local:" line shows the exact URL to use.

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If `http://localhost:5137` still doesn't work:
1. Check if Windows Firewall is blocking the port
2. Try `http://127.0.0.1:5137` instead
3. Let me know what error you see in the browser

The application is fully functional - we just needed the correct port number!
